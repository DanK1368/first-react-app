# First React App Project

## What's this all about

I have started to learn my firt JS library/framework which is React.
I'm following Shaun Pellings React Course, and this was the first project to introduce some core concepts and features of React.

This simple app allows you to add an event, pick a date, and choose from a list of locations.

You can hide and show the events, as well as delete an event from the list.

### Things I have learned and touched on during the building of this little project

- Why we need State and using useState
- How state and rendering works
- Using previous State
- Approaching the building of the site with components in mind
- Using props
- Styling
  - Global Stylesheet
  - component stylesheet
  - Inline styles & dynamic inline styles
  - conditional CSS classes
  - CSS modules
- onChange / onClick events
